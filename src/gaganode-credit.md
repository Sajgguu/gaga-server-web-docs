# ðŸ¦† GaGaNode Credit

GaGaNode follows the Tokenomics of Meson Network with a blockchain protocol model to replace the traditional labor-based sales models and consolidate and monetize idle Residential bandwidth resources from long-tail users at a low cost.

To get GaGaNode Credits, enthusiasts only need an idle Android phone, such as tvbox, Raspberry Pi, pc, and other electronic devices. Users do not need additional mining machine investment, they can contribute home bandwidth resources to obtain GaGaNode Credits.
