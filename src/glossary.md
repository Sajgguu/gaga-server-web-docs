### IP Address

Your IP address is a code that uniquely identifies a network device, like a computer or a smartphone. Itâ€™s often described by analogy like a physical street address, but there is an important distinction â€“ because the code is logical (not arbitrary like a street address), it can change. Use WhatIsMyIPAddress to find what yours is right now.

Since your IP address is the principal identifier for your device on a network, your proxyâ€™s main job is to mask that IP address and replace it with a diï¬€erent one. There are many ways to do this, so there are many diï¬€erent types of proxies.

### Port

If an IP address is like a residential mailing address, then a port is more like an individual mailbox â€“ except every address has thousands of individual ones. Essentially, ports transmit specific types of information and are organized in such a way that data remains eï¬ƒciently categorized no matter where youâ€™re sending it.

For instance, port 25 is the default outgoing port for email. Your computer uses this system of ports (there are thousands) to determine what kind of data it is sending or receiving â€“ thatâ€™s how emails end up in inboxes instead of, for instance, on an HTTP web browser (which uses port80).

### ASN

Your autonomous system number (ASN) refers to particular digits that identify a group of IP addresses. You can think of autonomous systems as being one level up along the hierarchy of data identification on the Internet. Diï¬€erent countries and ISPs have diï¬€erent ASNs.

### Subnet

A subnet is a smaller group of individual device identities located on a single unified network. For instance, in a corporate oï¬ƒce building, multiple devices may share the same IP address and have diï¬€erent subnets keeping them distinct and organized.

### VPS

When an internet hosting service sells a virtual private server (VPS), it is allowing access to a specific component of an existing server according to its usersâ€™ needs. This may or may not correspond to a specific physical device â€“ because the server is virtual, it doesnâ€™t have to.

This bridges the gap between selling dedicated server usage and shared server usage. Shared servers stuff multiple users into a single physical device, while dedicated servers are private, one-to-one devices. A VPS oï¬€ers privacy without forcing users to accommodate a specific physical device.
